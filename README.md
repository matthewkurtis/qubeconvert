# qubeconvert
This simple utility app will convert Qube Money™ bank statements from a PDF to a CSV file for import into financial platforms.

The statements generated by Qube Money™ only show the last 4 digits of the bank account number, but in an effort to be responsible when dealing with personal financial data, this service runs on the server only in memory and does not persist any personal data. Console logs only print status and errors for developer debugging. 

***No financial data is saved or persisted beyond the user's web session.***

## How does the web app work?
Simply upload a Qube Money statement pdf file (or multiple files) and a csv file of that data will be returned as a download.

## Can I self-host this?
Yes, QubeConvert is run via 2 docker containers:
- "qubeconvert-backend" is Python 3.11 with FastAPI
- "qubeconvert-frontend" is Nginx with a simple vanilla javascript/html/css static site
Run the docker-compose file to spin up the backend on :8000 and frontend on :3000 with no configuration needed.
