# qubeconvert
Convert Qube bank statements to CSV for import into financial platforms run via Docker

In an effort to be as responsible as possible with personal financial data, this service runs in memory only and only logs errors for developer debugging. 
No financial data is saved or persisted beyond the user's web session.

Simply upload a Qube Money statement pdf file (or multiple files) and a csv file of that data will be returned.
